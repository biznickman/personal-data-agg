Trade committee head Bernd Lange has called an emergency meeting, while EU ambassadors will also review the situation.\n\nMarkets reacted negatively, with the Stoxx Europe 600 slipping.\n\nTrump’s revised tariff plan—raising a global rate from 10% to 15%—has created uncertainty among US trading partners. The EU had hoped the deal would avoid a trade war, despite terms that include a 15% tariff on most EU exports and 50% duties on steel and aluminum.\n\nThis is the second time lawmakers have frozen the process, following earlier tensions over Trump’s Greenland remarks. Approval had been targeted for March, but remains uncertain pending further negotiations.",

Trump called the ruling misguided and warned of further decisions he believes could favor other nations.\n\nDespite the criticism, he said the outcome strengthens his ability to act on trade, reaffirming his focus on “America First” policies.",
